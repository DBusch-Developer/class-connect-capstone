# CAPSTONE

## How it's going to work

- Give your capstone idea to your instructor by Friday, May 9th.
- Daily standups, 8:15. AM.
- Presentations June 25th.

## Requirements MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

To be the best cohort ever. What does that look like? How would you define it? Full stack? CRUD? CSS framework? Login? Chatbot? Scrum? Just think about that - if every single student in a cohort were able to accomplish that. That is our goal, to show what is possible.

- Full stack MERN
- Full CRUD, all 4 parts, although DELETE can (and probably should) be ARCHIVE.
- Tailwind or Bootstrap or another framework if you want to go hog wild.
- A login is required. Ideally it would be using an updated login-starter, with Passport.js, but any version will suffice, as long as you are actually logging in and some code is checking to see if you are logged in.

## Requirements Alternatives

What if I am doing a game project?

- Good question. You still need a login and full stack and part of CRUD.
- You can handle the login however you want, separately from the game, but you still need a login. The login information will need to be available to the game.
- You will need the option to save your game info, so there is at least a CREATE.

## Optional MERN

- Chatbot. Don't say it's AI though. For realsies.

## Optional Game

- It would be super cool if the user could load from a saved game, READ.

## Capstone Examples

- Retail site, with cart, checkout.
- A working, full CRUD version of a project from the Code-a-thon.
- A library app, with book CRUD, user CRUD, book checkout.
- A game, with a login and basic account management.
- A project tracker (meet with the instructor).
- A chat application.

## Concepts

- You should be able to explain CRUD and why it's useful to your application.
- You should be able to explain how your login works, what libraries it uses and if you are still logged in on another tab.

## Notes

- Try not to get released before presentations. jk, get out of here you little scamps.
